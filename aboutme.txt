Hi! I'm <Ritik Negi/>.
I am here to assist you in creating a website.
which will appear astounding. And will inspire confidence in your viewer as soon as they access your website.


The basics of who I am
Coding is the only thing I can do effectively.
I am a self-taught web developer as well.
All of the free resources on the internet are where I study.
If I'm not coding, odds are that I'm either learning a new skill or amusing myself online with a wide range of things like playing video games, mindlessly browsing the internet, or looking through Instagram memes.


Future objectives I'm pursuing
To upgrade my web development capabilities.
Desire to learn how to use a linux system.
Furthermore to get new skills to polish my web development work, such as photoshop and others.
